## Description

This project is a portfolio project through [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) Front-End Engineer course. The goal of the project was to design, develop, and document a minimal [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) client using React & Redux.

## Wireframes

These were completed with pen and paper that was then used to layout the site in Figma. However, I still need to get them in digital format to display here

## Technologies

This project makes use of the following technologies:

| *Technology*||
|---|---|
| **React** | For building user interface of the application |
| **Redux** | For application state management |
| **Cypress** | For writing and executing E2E tests |

---

## Features

This project allows the user to do the following:

| *Feature*||
|---|---|
| **Search** | Users are able to search for a specific subreddit
| **Filter** | Users are able to filter by trending values or by selected subreddit. |
| **View Comments** | Users ar able to view comments, but not make any

## Future Additions

Here are some additional features that I want to add in the future. These were not originally part of the original project parameters, but I think they will ehance the user experience of the site:

- ### Dark / Light Mode
- ### Sharable Links
- ### Upvote / Downvote

## Run Locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

> Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

> The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
> You will also see any lint errors in the console.<br />

### `npm test`

> Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
> See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run cypress`

> Launches the cypress test runner for E2E testing watch mode.

### `npm run build`

> Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. <br />
