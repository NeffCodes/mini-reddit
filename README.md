## Run Locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

> Runs the app in the development mode.  
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
> The page will reload if you make edits.  
> You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

> Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
> See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

> Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
